  <!-- The Problem -->

      <h2 class="section-title">Modern web development has drifted away from its roots.</h2>
      <div class="content-grid">
        <div class="content-block">
          <p class="lead">Tools are abstracted. Platforms rent you access. Complexity is marketed as sophistication.</p>
          <p>Most people are trapped in a cycle of:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Handing autonomy to drag-and-drop builders</li>
            <li>Paying monthly subscriptions for platforms they don't need</li>
            <li>Building bloated, slow websites</li>
            <li>Believing gatekeeper lies that building great websites is only for "real" developers</li>

          <p class="lead">This is not a bootcamp.<br>It's not a SaaS course.<br>It's not a credential.</p>
          <p class="lead">It's a return to fundamentals.</p>
          <p>We teach people to work directly with files, understand what the browser actually does, use the command line as a tool (not a threat), build fast and simple websites, deploy them on infrastructure they control, and use AI as a lever—not a crutch.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">How It Works</h2>
      <div class="content-grid">
        <div class="content-block">
          <p class="lead">The Web Dev Rebellion lives on your computer, in your own filesystem.</p>
          <p>This is a return to the roots of web development—working directly with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. No complex frameworks. No abstracted tools. Just the fundamentals that have powered the web since the beginning.</p>
          <p>But we're not stuck in the past. You'll learn to use <strong>Cursor</strong>, the modern code editor (think VS Code, but built for the AI era). Cursor gives you the power of AI assistance right in your editor, helping you write code faster while you stay in control. It's the perfect bridge between old-school fundamentals and modern efficiency.</p>
          <p>Here's how it works: You download the learning system to your computer. It's a collection of files—lessons, examples, projects—that you can open, read, modify, and learn from at your own pace. You work through the material using Cursor, building real websites as you go. Everything lives on your machine. You own it completely.</p>
