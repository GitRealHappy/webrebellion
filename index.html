        Whether you're a business owner who's ready to take control of your own digital presence, a creator who's ready to launch your own digital product, or an employee who wants to build your own side hustle, this is the skill that gives you back your time, your money, and your freedom.
      </p>
      <p class="sales-subtagline">
        Fellow seeker,
      </p>
      <p>
        You already know the internet is shifting under our feet.
        AI can write code. Tools are faster. Barriers to entry are dissolving.
        And yet, most people are still either building websites the slow, expensive, outdated way, or they're signing up for free trials on the endless "new" AI tools that promise to "do everything for you."
      </p>
      <p>
        They hand their autonomy to drag-and-drop builders, pay monthly subscriptions for platforms they don’t need,
       build bloated and slow Wordpress sites, and stay stuck in the belief that becoming an independent builder is too hard.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, a small number of people have quietly stepped out of that system and discovered something shocking:
        Building professional websites is now faster than it has ever been… and wildly more profitable for those who
        know how to wield these tools.
      </p>
      <p>You can become one of them.</p>
      <p>I'm going to show you how.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="sales-section">
      <h2>The Problem You're Living With</h2>
      <p>You're a creator. Someone with real ideas and real potential.</p>
      <p>But every time you try to launch something, you hit the same walls.</p>
      <p><strong>Maybe you're:</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li>Overpaying for platforms that promise simplicity but deliver bloat.</li>
        <li>Dependent on developers who cost $2,000-$5,000 and take weeks to make adjustments.</li>
        <li>Spreading yourself thin across 47 different tools.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Or maybe:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your best creative energy goes to your job, not your projects.</li>
        <li>You think you need 6-12 months to become an "actual" web developer.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Meanwhile, 6 months go by.</p>
      <p>And nothing changes.</p>
      <p>You're still stuck in the same cycle: great ideas, no execution. Dependent on platforms. Dependent on other people. Watching others launch while you're still planning.</p>
      <p><strong>Here's the truth no one tells you:</strong></p>
      <p>Web development in 2026 is not what it was in 2016.</p>
      <p>The tools have changed. The speed has changed. The barrier to entry has collapsed.</p>
      <p>I built my first client-ready website in a weekend. I created systems to make the process even faster. I guided others through the same transformation.</p>
      <p>And I realized something powerful: <strong>99% of people still have no idea how fast and how simple it has become.</strong></p>
      <p>You don't need to become a "real" developer.</p>
      <p>You need to understand the fundamentals (basic HTML and CSS) and know how to wield AI with precision.</p>
      <p>This course exists to give you that power.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="sales-section">
      <h2>How I Went From Frustrated Creator to Independent Builder (And How You Can Too)</h2>
      <p>Three years ago, I was exactly where you are.</p>
      <p>I had offers ready. Products ready. Ideas I knew could work.</p>
      <p>But I couldn't get them live fast enough.</p>
      <p>I was paying $500/year for a WordPress site that took me three days to update. I was dependent on platforms that controlled my entire digital presence.</p>
      <p>I felt trapped.</p>
      <p>Then I discovered something that changed everything: <strong>Real web development had become radically simpler—but no one was teaching it the new way.</strong></p>
      <p>The old way: Spend 6-12 months in a coding bootcamp learning computer science theory, frameworks, and languages you'll never use.</p>
      <p>The new way: Learn the fundamentals so you understand what's happening under the hood. Then use AI tools to write code 10x faster. Ship in a weekend. Iterate based on real feedback.</p>
      <p>I taught myself this approach. Built my first client-ready site in a weekend. Landed my first three clients within a month. Spent next to nothing on overhead.</p>
      <p>But more importantly: <strong>I took back control.</strong></p>
      <p>No more waiting on developers. No outrageous platform fees. No more being stuck because I couldn't execute my own vision.</p>
      <p>I could build what I wanted, when I wanted, and launch it the same day.</p>
      <p>That's the power I want to give you.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="sales-section">
      <h2>The Rebellion Method: Fundamentals + AI Leverage + Speed to Market</h2>
      <p>This isn't a traditional coding bootcamp. And it's not an "AI will do everything for you" fantasy course.</p>
      <p>It's a hybrid approach that gives you the best of both worlds:</p>
      
      <p><strong>Step 1: Understand the Fundamentals</strong></p>
      <p>You'll learn the core principles of web development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript basics, how websites actually work.</p>
      <p>Not to become a computer scientist. But to understand enough to be dangerous.</p>
      <p>This is your insurance policy against obsolescence. When AI tools change (and they will), you'll adapt. You won't be dependent on any single platform or tool.</p>

      <p><strong>Step 2: Master Skillful Prompting</strong></p>
      <p>You'll learn how to use AI tools (Cursor Pro with access to GPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok) to write code 10x - 100x faster.</p>
      <p>But you're not just copy-pasting AI output. You understand what it's doing and why. You can debug when it breaks. You can customize every pixel when you need something specific.</p>

      <p><strong>Step 3: Know Your Infrastructure</strong></p>
      <p>You'll understand your local directory system, shell commands, web hosting, domain management.</p>
      <p>These are the "root level" skills that put you in control of your computer and your projects. No more platform dependency. No more being locked into someone else's ecosystem.</p>

      <p><strong>Step 4: Build and Launch Fast</strong></p>
      <p>You'll ship your first website in a weekend. Get it live. Get feedback. Iterate.</p>
      <p>This is how real builders work. Not perfect, but shipped.</p>

      <p><strong>Step 5: Get Your First Clients (or Launch Your Product)</strong></p>
      <p>With your portfolio and the support of the community, you'll land your first 3-6 clients.</p>
      <p>Or launch your own digital product.</p>
      <p>Either way, you're making money within weeks of finishing the course.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="sales-section">
      <h2>What You'll Actually Achieve</h2>
      <p>By the end of 6 weeks, you'll be capable of building client-level websites and launching your own digital products.</p>
      <p><strong>Within 6 months, you could:</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Path A (Freelancer):</strong> Build 3-6 client websites and earn <strong>$3,000-$6,000</strong> in freelance income</p>
      <p><strong>Path B (Creator/Entrepreneur):</strong> Build or drastically improve your own digital product, and have the power to create a magnetic brand that makes sales.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Milestone outcomes:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>By Class 2 (Week 2):</strong> Building "fun stuff"—proof of concept, quick wins, momentum</li>
        <li><strong>By Class 4 (Week 4):</strong> Capable of building client-ready work</li>
        <li><strong>By Week 6:</strong> Portfolio-ready with 1-2 projects, ready to land first clients</li>

      <p><strong>Reasonable goal:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>By Month 6:</strong> $3K-$6K in freelance income OR $3K-$6K+ from your own digital product</li>
      </ul>

      <p>But the deeper outcome is this:</p>
      <p><strong>Greater confidence in your independence.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Belief that you can pursue your unique goals.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Freedom from the "job security" mentality.</strong></p>
      <p>You'll stop waiting for permission. You'll start building on your own terms.</p>
