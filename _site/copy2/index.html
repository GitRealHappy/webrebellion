<p><br />
You’re a creator. An entrepreneur. Someone with real ideas and real potential.<br />
<br />
But every time you try to launch something, you hit the same walls.<br />
<br />
<strong>You’re overpaying for platforms that promise simplicity but deliver bloat.</strong> Squarespace. WordPress. Webflow. They all say “anyone can build a website”—but you’re three hours deep in tutorials, drowning in features you don’t need, and still can’t get your landing page to look right.<br />
<br />
<strong>You’re dependent on developers who cost $2,000-$5,000 and take weeks.</strong> By the time they finish, your offer has changed. Your momentum is gone. You’ve moved on to the next idea.<br />
<br />
<strong>You’re spreading yourself thin across 47 different tools.</strong> Email platform. CMS. Analytics. Integrations. You spend more time managing tools than building your actual business.<br />
<br />
<strong>Your best creative energy goes to your job, not your projects.</strong> By the time you get home, you’re exhausted. The thing you actually care about—your own work—gets whatever’s left. Which is nothing.<br />
<br />
<strong>You’ve been told you need 6-12 months to learn web dev.</strong> So you haven’t started. The barrier feels too high. You convince yourself it’s not the right time.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, 6 months go by.<br />
<br />
And nothing changes.<br />
<br />
You’re still stuck in the same cycle: great ideas, no execution. Dependent on platforms. Dependent on other people. Watching others launch while you’re still planning.<br />
<br />
<strong>Here’s the truth no one tells you:</strong><br />
<br />
Web development in 2026 is not what it was in 2016.<br />
<br />
The tools have changed. The speed has changed. The barrier to entry has collapsed.<br />
<br />
I built my first client-ready website in a weekend. I created systems to make the process even faster. I guided others through the same transformation.<br />
<br />
And I realized something powerful: <strong>99% of people still have no idea how fast and how simple it has become.</strong><br />
<br />
You don’t need to become a developer.<br />
<br />
You need to understand the fundamentals and know how to wield AI with precision.<br />
<br />
This course exists to give you that power.<br />
<br />
—<br />
\</p>
<h2 id="how-i-went-from-frustrated-creator-to-independent-builder-and-how-you-can-too"><strong>How I Went From Frustrated Creator to Independent Builder (And How You Can Too)</strong>\</h2>
<p><br />
Three years ago, I was exactly where you are.<br />
<br />
I had offers ready. Products ready. Ideas I knew could work.<br />
<br />
But I couldn’t get them live fast enough.<br />
<br />
I was paying $500/year for a WordPress site that took me three days to update. I was dependent on platforms that controlled my entire digital presence.<br />
<br />
I felt trapped.<br />
<br />
Then I discovered something that changed everything: <strong>Real web development had become radically simpler—but no one was teaching it the new way.</strong><br />
<br />
The old way: Spend 6-12 months in a coding bootcamp learning computer science theory, frameworks, and languages you’ll never use.<br />
<br />
The new way: Learn the fundamentals so you understand what’s happening under the hood. Then use AI tools to write code 10x faster. Ship in a weekend. Iterate based on real feedback.<br />
<br />
I taught myself this approach. Built my first client-ready site in a weekend. Landed my first three clients within a month. Spent next to nothing on overhead.<br />
<br />
But more importantly: <strong>I took back control.</strong><br />
<br />
No more waiting on developers. No outrageous platform fees. No more being stuck because I couldn’t execute my own vision.<br />
<br />
I could build what I wanted, when I wanted, and launch it the same day.<br />
<br />
That’s the power I want to give you.<br />
<br />
—<br />
\</p>
<h2 id="the-rebellion-method-fundamentals--ai-leverage--speed-to-market"><strong>The Rebellion Method: Fundamentals + AI Leverage + Speed to Market</strong>\</h2>
<p><br />
This isn’t a traditional coding bootcamp. And it’s not an “AI will do everything for you” fantasy course.<br />
<br />
It’s a hybrid approach that gives you the best of both worlds:<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 1: Understand the Fundamentals</strong><br />
<br />
You’ll learn the core principles of web development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript basics, how websites actually work.<br />
<br />
Not to become a computer scientist. But to understand enough to be dangerous.<br />
<br />
This is your insurance policy against obsolescence. When AI tools change (and they will), you’ll adapt. You won’t be dependent on any single platform or tool.<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 2: Master Skillful Prompting</strong><br />
<br />
You’ll learn how to use AI tools (Cursor Pro with access to GPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok) to write code 10x - 100x faster.<br />
<br />
But you’re not just copy-pasting AI output. You understand what it’s doing and why. You can debug when it breaks. You can customize every pixel when you need something specific.<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 3: Know Your Infrastructure</strong><br />
<br />
You’ll understand your local directory system, shell commands, web hosting, domain management.<br />
<br />
These are the “root level” skills that put you in control of your computer and your projects. No more platform dependency. No more being locked into someone else’s ecosystem.<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 4: Build and Launch Fast</strong><br />
<br />
You’ll ship your first website in a weekend. Get it live. Get feedback. Iterate.<br />
<br />
This is how real builders work. Not perfect, but shipped.<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 5: Get Your First Clients (or Launch Your Product)</strong><br />
<br />
With your portfolio and the support of the community, you’ll land your first 3-6 clients.<br />
<br />
Or launch your own digital product.<br />
<br />
Either way, you’re making money within weeks of finishing the course.<br />
<br />
—<br />
\</p>
<h2 id="what-youll-actually-achieve"><strong>What You’ll Actually Achieve</strong>\</h2>
<p><br />
By the end of 6 weeks, you’ll be capable of building client-level websites and launching your own digital products.<br />
<br />
<strong>Within 6 months, you could:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Path A (Freelancer):</strong> Build 3-6 client websites and earn <strong>$3,000-$6,000</strong> in freelance income<br />
<br />
<strong>Path B (Creator/Entrepreneur):</strong> Build or drastically improve your own digital product, and have the power to create a magnetic brand that makes sales.<br />
<br />
<strong>Milestone outcomes:</strong><br />
\</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>By Class 2 (Week 2):</strong> Building “fun stuff”—proof of concept, quick wins, momentum\</li>
  <li><strong>By Class 4 (Week 4):</strong> Capable of building client-ready work\</li>
  <li><strong>By Week 6:</strong> Portfolio-ready with 1-2 projects, ready to land first clients</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Reasonable goal:</strong>\</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>By Month 6:</strong> $3K-$6K in freelance income OR $3K-$6K+ from your own digital product<br />
<br />
But the deeper outcome is this:<br />
<br />
<strong>Greater confidence in your independence.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Belief that you can pursue your unique goals.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Freedom from the “job security” mentality.</strong><br />
<br />
You’ll stop waiting for permission. You’ll start building on your own terms.<br />

    <h2 id="the-rebellion-guarantee-your-success-or-your-money-back"><strong>The Rebellion Guarantee: Your Success or Your Money Back</strong>\</h2>

<strong>Here’s my guarantee:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Through Class 2:</strong> If you don’t genuinely feel you’re on your way to having a high-value freelance skill, I’ll refund you 100%. No questions. No friction. No hard feelings.<br />
<br />
<strong>Through Class 3:</strong> If you complete all classes and don’t feel like you’re getting value, you get a personalized 1-on-1 call with me to address your specific concerns or areas of difficulty. If after that call you’re still not confident in the value of this, you’ll receive a full refund.<br />
<br />
<strong>The only condition:</strong> You must actually attend the classes. (This filters for serious students and ensures you get the full value.)<br />
