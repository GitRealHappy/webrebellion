## **The Problem You're Living With**\
\
You're a creator. An entrepreneur. Someone with real ideas and real potential.\
\
But every time you try to launch something, you hit the same walls.\
\
**You're overpaying for platforms that promise simplicity but deliver bloat.** Squarespace. WordPress. Webflow. They all say "anyone can build a website"—but you're three hours deep in tutorials, drowning in features you don't need, and still can't get your landing page to look right.\
\
**You're dependent on developers who cost $2,000-$5,000 and take weeks.** By the time they finish, your offer has changed. Your momentum is gone. You've moved on to the next idea.\
\
**You're spreading yourself thin across 47 different tools.** Email platform. CMS. Analytics. Integrations. You spend more time managing tools than building your actual business.\
\
**Your best creative energy goes to your job, not your projects.** By the time you get home, you're exhausted. The thing you actually care about—your own work—gets whatever's left. Which is nothing.\
\
**You've been told you need 6-12 months to learn web dev.** So you haven't started. The barrier feels too high. You convince yourself it's not the right time.\
\
Meanwhile, 6 months go by.\
\
And nothing changes.\
\
You're still stuck in the same cycle: great ideas, no execution. Dependent on platforms. Dependent on other people. Watching others launch while you're still planning.\
\
**Here's the truth no one tells you:**\
\
Web development in 2026 is not what it was in 2016.\
\
The tools have changed. The speed has changed. The barrier to entry has collapsed.\
\
I built my first client-ready website in a weekend. I created systems to make the process even faster. I guided others through the same transformation.\
\
And I realized something powerful: **99% of people still have no idea how fast and how simple it has become.**\
\
You don't need to become a developer.\
\
You need to understand the fundamentals and know how to wield AI with precision.\
\
This course exists to give you that power.\

\
## **How I Went From Frustrated Creator to Independent Builder (And How You Can Too)**\
\
Three years ago, I was exactly where you are.\
\
I had offers ready. Products ready. Ideas I knew could work.\
\
But I couldn't get them live fast enough.\
\
I was paying $500/year for a WordPress site that took me three days to update. I was dependent on platforms that controlled my entire digital presence.\
\
I felt trapped.\
\
Then I discovered something that changed everything: **Real web development had become radically simpler—but no one was teaching it the new way.**\
\
The old way: Spend 6-12 months in a coding bootcamp learning computer science theory, frameworks, and languages you'll never use.\
\
The new way: Learn the fundamentals so you understand what's happening under the hood. Then use AI tools to write code 10x faster. Ship in a weekend. Iterate based on real feedback.\
\
I taught myself this approach. Built my first client-ready site in a weekend. Landed my first three clients within a month. Spent next to nothing on overhead.\
\
But more importantly: **I took back control.**\
\
No more waiting on developers. No outrageous platform fees. No more being stuck because I couldn't execute my own vision.\
\
I could build what I wanted, when I wanted, and launch it the same day.\
\
That's the power I want to give you.\
\

\
## **The Rebellion Method: Fundamentals + AI Leverage + Speed to Market**\
\
This isn't a traditional coding bootcamp. And it's not an "AI will do everything for you" fantasy course.\
\
It's a hybrid approach that gives you the best of both worlds:\
\
**Step 1: Understand the Fundamentals**\
\
You'll learn the core principles of web development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript basics, how websites actually work.\
\
Not to become a computer scientist. But to understand enough to be dangerous.\
\
This is your insurance policy against obsolescence. When AI tools change (and they will), you'll adapt. You won't be dependent on any single platform or tool.\
\
**Step 2: Master Skillful Prompting**\
\
You'll learn how to use AI tools (Cursor Pro with access to GPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok) to write code 10x - 100x faster.\
\
But you're not just copy-pasting AI output. You understand what it's doing and why. You can debug when it breaks. You can customize every pixel when you need something specific.\
\
**Step 3: Know Your Infrastructure**\
\
You'll understand your local directory system, shell commands, web hosting, domain management.\
\
These are the "root level" skills that put you in control of your computer and your projects. No more platform dependency. No more being locked into someone else's ecosystem.\
\
**Step 4: Build and Launch Fast**\
\
You'll ship your first website in a weekend. Get it live. Get feedback. Iterate.\
\
This is how real builders work. Not perfect, but shipped.\
\
**Step 5: Get Your First Clients (or Launch Your Product)**\
\
With your portfolio and the support of the community, you'll land your first 3-6 clients.\
\
Or launch your own digital product.\
\
Either way, you're making money within weeks of finishing the course.\
\
---\
\
## **What You'll Actually Achieve**\
\
By the end of 6 weeks, you'll be capable of building client-level websites and launching your own digital products.\
\
**Within 6 months, you could:**\
\
**Path A (Freelancer):** Build 3-6 client websites and earn **$3,000-$6,000** in freelance income\
\
**Path B (Creator/Entrepreneur):** Build or drastically improve your own digital product, and have the power to create a magnetic brand that makes sales.\
\
**Milestone outcomes:**\
\
* **By Class 2 (Week 2):** Building "fun stuff"—proof of concept, quick wins, momentum\
* **By Class 4 (Week 4):** Capable of building client-ready work\
* **By Week 6:** Portfolio-ready with 1-2 projects, ready to land first clients

**Reasonable goal:**\
* **By Month 6:** $3K-$6K in freelance income OR $3K-$6K+ from your own digital product\
\
But the deeper outcome is this:\
\
**Greater confidence in your independence.**\
\
**Belief that you can pursue your unique goals.**\
\
**Freedom from the "job security" mentality.**\
\
You'll stop waiting for permission. You'll start building on your own terms.\
