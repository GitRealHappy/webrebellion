### Your Dev Environment: Ship-Ready from Day One

The first step to building anything real is having the right tools. We're not about theoretical setups; we're about a development environment that lets you write good code and ship it **fast**.

Many learning platforms use in-browser editors. They're fine for a quick start, but they don't build real-world skills. We're building the environment that mirrors professional workflows. This means installations.

Yes, installing software, editors, and even operating systems can be a pain. Embrace the friction. This is an **invaluable, real-world skill** that separates builders from dabblers.

### Your Path to a Dev Environment

We focus on environments that work. Deviations add complexity we don't need.

#### Recommended: macOS or Linux

If you're on a Mac, you're already in a Unix-like environment – perfect. A few key installations and you're set.

If you're not on a Mac, **Linux is your best bet**. It's free, powerful, and the environment most tools are built for. We'll guide you through Ubuntu, a battle-tested, user-friendly distribution.

### Windows Users: Your Options

Windows itself isn't natively supported for the core development tools we'll use. You need a Linux layer. Here are your paths:

- **Virtual Machine (Recommended for Ease):** Run a Linux environment (like Ubuntu) within a program on your Windows machine. It's like having a separate computer inside your computer. Easy to set up, risk-free to remove if it's not for you.
- **Dual-Boot (Native Performance):** Install Linux alongside Windows. You choose which OS to boot when your computer starts. Offers the best performance as Linux has full access to your hardware. Requires careful partitioning – take your time.
- **WSL2 (Advanced):** The Windows Subsystem for Linux lets you run a Linux environment directly within Windows. Powerful, but can be confusing for beginners due to the blurred lines between OSs.

*Chromebooks:* You may be able to leverage built-in Linux support. Details in the next step.

### Why This Approach?

- **Tested Environments:** Our instructions are validated on macOS and Ubuntu. This minimizes troubleshooting time so you can focus on coding.
- **Community Alignment:** Using recommended tools makes it easier to get support from The Rebel Alliance.
- **Tooling Native to Linux:** Many critical development tools are built for or run best on Linux.
- **Professional Standard:** Most developers use Unix-based systems. Get acquainted now.
- **Performance:** Linux is lean. It uses fewer resources than Windows, making it ideal for powerful development, even on older hardware.

### No Getting Around It

We can only support specific environments. Native Windows is **not** supported for development. This isn't a limitation; it's a deliberate choice to ensure you have the smoothest path to shipping code. Stick to macOS, Ubuntu, or a Linux environment via VM/dual-boot/WSL2.

The goal is to get you building and shipping, not wrestling with incompatible tools. Let's get your environment ship-shape.
