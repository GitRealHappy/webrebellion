### Your Dev Environment: Ship-Ready

If you're on macOS, Ubuntu, or an official Ubuntu flavor, and have Google Chrome installed, you can likely skip the heavy lifting. Otherwise, let's build your battle station.

**The Goal:** A robust development environment that lets you build and ship fast. We use tools that mirror professional workflows.

### Choosing Your Weapon: Operating System Setup

We support environments built for development.

- **macOS:** Unix-based and great for development. A few installs and you're ready.
- **Linux (Ubuntu Recommended):** Free, powerful, and the standard for many tools. We guide you through Ubuntu.

#### Windows Users: Your Path

Windows isn't natively supported for our core tools. You need a Linux layer:

- **Virtual Machine (Recommended):** Run Ubuntu inside Windows. Easiest, safest way to start.
- **Dual-Boot:** Install Ubuntu alongside Windows. Native performance, but requires disk partitioning. Proceed with care.
- **WSL2 (Advanced):** Linux environment within Windows. Powerful, but can be complex for beginners.

*Chromebooks:* Built-in Linux support is viable. Details follow.

### Why Google Chrome?

It's the de facto browser standard, with powerful developer tools essential for inspecting, debugging, and testing your sites. Our instructions and examples are based on Chrome.

### Your Assignment

1. **Environment Setup (if needed):**
   - **Virtual Machine:** Easiest. Get Ubuntu running within Windows/macOS.
   - **Dual-Boot:** Install Ubuntu alongside your existing OS.
   - **ChromeOS/Flex:** For Chromebooks.
   - **WSL2:** For advanced Windows users.
   *(Follow the specific guides for your chosen setup.)*

2. **Browser Setup:** Install Google Chrome. Our documentation and examples assume you're using it.

**Unsupported:** We don't support Raspberry Pi or other niche devices. Stick to standard desktops/laptops.

**Focus:** Get your environment configured correctly. This smooths the path for all subsequent learning. If you're not on macOS or Ubuntu, choose ONE setup option and follow it precisely.
