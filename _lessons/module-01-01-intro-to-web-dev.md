### What is a Web Developer?

In short, web developers build and maintain websites.

Web developers often work for clients who need to establish an online presence. The work is typically project-focused and involves collaborating with a team to translate client needs into a functional product. Clients can range from tech companies to small businesses and organizations. The work may involve front-end, back-end, or full-stack development.

Web development is a strong career choice if you enjoy logical problem-solving, building tangible things, and experimenting with new technologies. Demand for web developers is high, offering good work-life balance and competitive salaries. It's worth researching your local market to understand specific opportunities.

### Types of Web Developers

We often categorize web development into front-end, back-end, and full-stack.

The **front end** encompasses everything the user sees and interacts with in their browser – the presentation, content, and user interface elements. Front-end developers use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with their frameworks, to create effective content presentation and user experiences.

The **back end** comprises the server-side logic, data storage, and management that powers the website. Back-end developers use languages like Java, Python, Ruby, or JavaScript to handle data and ensure the front end has what it needs, a process that scales significantly with user traffic.

**Full-stack developers** are proficient in both front-end and back-end development. This curriculum aims to equip you with full-stack capabilities.

### Types of Careers

Beyond the technical roles, consider the environments you might work in:

- **Large Tech Companies (e.g., Google, Meta):** Offer high compensation and benefits but have rigorous hiring standards.
- **Startups:** Characterized by a fast-paced, sometimes chaotic environment. May offer lower initial salaries and longer hours but can provide equity and unique experiences.
- **Freelancing:** Provides autonomy and strong earning potential but requires self-management for finding clients, billing, and project delivery. Strong people skills are crucial.
- **Web Consultancies:** Offer a balance, focusing more on code and less on client acquisition than freelancing, with good pay and work-life balance.
- **Established Companies:** Need web developers but often operate with slower development cycles compared to tech-focused firms, offering stable work environments.
