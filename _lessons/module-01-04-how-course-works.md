### Introduction

The Living Internet University is dedicated to providing the most effective resources for aspiring creator/entrepreneurs, guiding you from zero to ship-ready.

This unit introduces the fundamentals of the web, your computer, and the development environment. We'll cover crucial concepts like Git and GitHub, and the basics of front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), with a glimpse into back-end principles.

By the end of this foundational stage, you'll understand the web's mechanics, differentiate key technologies, and be able to build and style a basic, interactive webpage using the command line. This broad overview provides essential context before diving deeper.

### How It Works

The Rebellion curates the best existing resources on the internet to teach specific topics. Each module introduces a subject, provides context, and then directs you to external materials.

Most modules include questions to check your understanding and exercises for practice. Crucially, we emphasize **building projects** to solidify your knowledge.

Think of The Rebellion not as a traditional class, but as a snowball rolling downhill. You are the snowball. Information sticks as you progress. You'll forget things, and that's natural. Don't worry if a project feels challenging; **projects are not tests of memorization.** They are practical application points where learned information resurfaces as you tackle problems, leveraging search engines and The Rebel Alliance for support.

### A Note About Tools

We often field questions about why certain languages or tools aren't covered. The Rebellion's goal isn't to teach isolated skills but to instill the *principles* of web development and fundamentally change how you approach problems.

Mastering the core concepts – problem-solving, asking effective questions, conducting research – is paramount. This foundational skill set makes learning new tools and languages straightforward. Once you grasp the underlying *why* and *how*, the specifics are usually a Google search away. Documentation becomes your primary resource, and The Rebellion equips you with the skills to confidently navigate it.

The abilities you gain here are transferable and will serve as your base for continuous learning throughout your career. If you feel you need another course *like this* to learn a new language, you've likely missed the core message: self-sufficiency.

### A Note About Language

This curriculum is delivered in English. While this fact is not meant to discourage non-native speakers, it prepares you for the reality of the global development landscape, where English is the predominant language for technical communication, documentation, and community interaction.

If English is not your primary language, dedicate extra time to understanding unfamiliar terms. Seek out resources in your native language to clarify concepts. Using a translation dictionary can also be helpful. Developing the skill to find and utilize such tools online is, in itself, a valuable part of your journey.

### What Comes Next

Upon completing this foundational course, you should feel equipped with the essentials and eager to delve deeper. While we cover core topics comprehensively, they are just the beginning.

The final module will offer a choice between Full Stack JavaScript and Full Stack Rails paths, building directly upon this foundation. Each path hones your skills for practical application.

Everything in this curriculum is intentionally included and vital for your success. **DO NOT SKIP ANYTHING!** Each part builds upon the last; skipping sections creates knowledge gaps that impede your ability to solve problems and understand new material. Additional resources are supplementary unless explicitly stated otherwise.
