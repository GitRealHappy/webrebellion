### Your Primary Weapon: The Code Editor

You'll spend more time in your text editor than almost anywhere else. A good one isn't just for typing; it's a force multiplier that helps you write cleaner, faster, error-free code.

**Why not Microsoft Word?** Word and similar "rich text" editors embed formatting information within your files. Code editors, on the other hand, handle **plain text** – exactly what computers need to read and execute your code. No hidden formatting, just pure instructions.

### The Code Editor Advantage

Think of code editors as specialized command centers. They are designed for developers and come packed with features that streamline your workflow:

- **Syntax Highlighting:** Makes code readable by coloring different elements.
- **Real-time Error Checking (Linting):** Catches syntax errors and style issues *as you type*.
- **Auto-formatting:** Keeps your code clean and consistent.
- **Bracket/Brace Matching:** Prevents those maddening "missing bracket" bugs.
- **Extensibility:** Tons of plugins and extensions to customize your environment.
- **AI Integration:** Modern editors can leverage AI to accelerate your coding.

### Your Tool of Choice: Cursor

We standardize on **Cursor** – an AI-native code editor that The Rebellion Method is built around. It's based on VS Code, so it has all the same power and extensions, but with AI capabilities built right in.

**Why Cursor?**
- **AI-Native:** Built from the ground up with AI assistance in mind.
- **VS Code Foundation:** All the extensions and features you'd expect from a modern editor.
- **Skillful Prompting:** Learn to direct AI to write code, explain concepts, and debug issues.
- **Ship Faster:** Once you understand the fundamentals, AI handles the manual labor.
- **Great Git Integration:** Essential for version control.

**Important:** If you're using a Virtual Machine for Linux, **install Cursor *inside* the VM**. This ensures your development environment is self-contained.

### Your Mission

Familiarize yourself with Cursor. Explore its interface – it will feel familiar if you've used VS Code before. The key difference is the AI integration.

**Getting Started with AI in Cursor:**
- Press `Cmd + K` (Mac) or `Ctrl + K` (Windows/Linux) to open the AI prompt bar.
- Try asking it to explain a concept or generate a simple code snippet.
- Use `Cmd + L` (Mac) or `Ctrl + L` (Windows/Linux) to open the AI chat panel for longer conversations.

Don't worry about mastering AI prompting yet – we'll build that skill throughout the curriculum. For now, just get comfortable with the editor itself.
