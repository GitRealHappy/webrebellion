### Organize Information: Ordered and Unordered Lists

Lists are fundamental for presenting information clearly. This lesson covers how to create both unordered (bulleted) and ordered (numbered) lists in HTML.

### What You'll Master

- **Unordered Lists (`<ul>`):** For items where order doesn't matter.
- **Ordered Lists (`<ol>`):** For items where sequence is crucial.
- **List Items (`<li>`):** The building blocks for all lists.
</div>

### Creating Lists

#### Unordered Lists (`<ul>`)

Use `<ul>` for lists where the sequence of items is flexible (e.g., shopping lists, features). Each item is defined with `<li>`.

```html
<ul>
  <li>Item 1: Bullet points</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>
```

#### Ordered Lists (`<ol>`)

Use `<ol>` for lists where the order is important (e.g., instructions, rankings). Each item is still defined with `<li>`, but the browser automatically numbers them.

```html
<ol>
  <li>First step: Do this.</li>
  <li>Second step: Then do that.</li>
  <li>Third step: Finish up.</li>
</ol>
```
