### HTML and CSS: The Dynamic Duo

HTML provides the raw content – the text, the images, the links. CSS takes that raw content and makes it sing – positioning elements, adding color, choosing fonts, and creating a polished look.

While some call them 'programming languages,' technically, they are *markup* and *styling* languages. They define *what* is on the page and *how* it looks, not the logic that makes it *do* things. That's JavaScript's domain, which you'll conquer next. But for now, master HTML and CSS. They are your essential toolkit.
