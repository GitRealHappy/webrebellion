### Tips for Getting the Best Help Possible

#### Always Provide Your Code and Surrounding Context

When asking for help, include your code, error messages, terminal output, and any other relevant details. Be specific, pinpointing the exact function, line number, or error. Providing comprehensive context drastically reduces the need for back-and-forth clarification, making it easier for others to assist you.

Without sufficient context, your problem remains unclear, leading to delayed or ineffective solutions and potential frustration for both you and those trying to help. If your question is purely conceptual, state that clearly.

### Ask About the Problem, Not the Solution Itself

Avoid asking for direct solutions to assignments, such as: "How do I complete Step 5 of the Rock Paper Scissors Assignment?" The process of figuring out the approach is fundamental to learning.

A better question focuses on the problem:
"Hey, I'm trying to return a string that displays the winner in Rock Paper Scissors, but I'm getting a syntax error on line 12. Here's my code. Can you help me understand why this error is occurring?"

Sharing your attempts allows helpers to identify what hasn't worked and build upon your current progress. If you're completely unsure where to start, state that. Ask for guidance on where to begin or what resources to research. Sharing pseudo-code can also help clarify your thinking and identify potential misunderstandings.

### Don't Take Asking for More Context Personally

Community helpers are volunteers who want to assist you. If they ask for more context, it's because your initial question, while perhaps clear to you, isn't sufficiently detailed for them to diagnose effectively. Experts know numerous potential causes for issues and need specifics to avoid sending you down the wrong path. Respect their time and judgment by providing the information they request. Remember, their help is voluntary.
